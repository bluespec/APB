= APB Transactor for CPU Near-Mems

This repository has been repurposed from AHB-Lite sources in `Bluespec_RISCV` for
use with a CPU near-mems. The current version only supports single requests. In
general the transactors can be used with any sort of near-mem.

While the repository does support standalone testing of the master with a memory
model attached to a AHB-Lite slave, it is meant to be eventually used as an
adapter with a CPU's Near-Mem implementation.
